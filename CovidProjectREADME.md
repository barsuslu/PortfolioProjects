# PortfolioProjects

The Covid Statistics data is taken from Our World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) for the dates between 24.02.2020 to 30.04.2021. 

Cleaned and created two different tables from the raw data where one is showing the Covid cases and deaths and the other one is showing the Covid vaccinations.

Either by using one of the tables or joining both, several analyses were done using SQL (SQLite). Created Excel tables for each outcome and these tables will 
be used for visualizations and dashboards in Tableau.
